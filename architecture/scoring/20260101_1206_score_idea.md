Building a **Leader Scoring Engine** is where your platform transitions from a simple administrative tool to a powerful **AI-driven strategic partner**.

While your competitors stop at "how many emails did they send," you can measure **political effectiveness**. This is your "Maximum Value" and your ultimate "Moat."

## 1. The Multi-Dimensional Scoring Framework

To be unique, your algorithm shouldn't just be one number. It should be an **Aggregate Score** based on four distinct "Performance Pillars."

### Pillar A: Organizational Growth (The "Builder" Score)

* **KPIs:** New member sign-ups attributed to the leader, member retention rate in their ward, and committee vacancy rate.
* **Data Source:** Membership Context.
* **Formula Logic:** Higher weights for members who successfully complete their **Digital Card** verification.

### Pillar B: Engagement & Deliberation (The "Influence" Score)

* **KPIs:** Forum participation, "upvotes" on policy proposals, and sentiment analysis of their contributions.
* **Data Source:** DiscussionForum Context.
* **Formula Logic:** Penalize for toxicity; reward for consensus-building and constructive debate.

### Pillar C: Operational Integrity (The "Trust" Score)

* **KPIs:** Timely filing of financial reports, percentage of digital voting participation in their district, and "Hierarchy Health" (Are all their sub-committees active?).
* **Data Source:** Finance & Election Contexts.
* **Formula Logic:** This is a binary "Pass/Fail" or "Red/Green" multiplier. If transparency is low, the overall score drops significantly.

### Pillar D: Social & Geographical Impact (The "Ground Game" Score)

* **KPIs:** Attendance at physical meetings (verified by QR scan), diversity of membership (Youth/Gender balance in their ward).
* **Data Source:** Geography + DigitalCard Contexts.

## 2. Visualizing the Scoring Logic

Think of the Leader Score as a **Radar Chart** (Spider Chart) rather than a simple list. This allows the party leadership to see a leader's profile at a glance.

* **The "Orator":** High Influence Score, Low Organizational Score.
* **The "Technocrat":** High Integrity Score, Low Influence Score.
* **The "Mobilizer":** High Ground Game and Growth Scores.

## 3. Critical Competitive Analysis: Why This is Unique

| Feature | Standard CRM (NationBuilder) | **Your Leader Scoring Engine** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Verification** | Unverified clicks/opens | **Verified QR-scanned physical presence** |
| **Logic** | Sales-driven (Donations) | **Governance-driven (Institutional Health)** |
| **Hierarchy** | Flat (Global) | **Relative (Ranked against other Ward Leaders)** |
| **Outcome** | More emails sent | **Identification of the next National Candidate** |

## 4. Implementation Strategy (The "Maximum" Offering)

To avoid the "chaos mind," don't build the algorithm yet. Instead, ensure your **MVP Contexts** (Membership & Geography) are collecting the right "Scoreable Events."

1. **Event Sourcing:** Every time a member is added, fire a `MemberJoined` event. The Scoring Context "listens" to this and updates the Leader's "Builder" score.
2. **Relative Benchmarking:** Instead of a score of 85/100, show the leader as **"Top 5% of Ward Leaders in the Province."** This creates healthy internal competition.
3. **The "Meritocratic" Dashboard:** Display this to the Party High Command. They can now see which local leaders are *actually* working versus those who are just "well-connected."

## 5. Your Final Roadmap to Market

1. **Phase 1 (The Backbone):** Multi-tenancy + Geography + Verified Membership (Digital Cards).
2. **Phase 2 (The Revenue):** Subscription Management + Module Registry (Sell the "Finance" module separately).
3. **Phase 3 (The Differentiator):** **Leader Scoring Engine.** Use the data from Phase 1 to prove to the party that you can find their best future candidates.

**Since "Geography" is the root of all your data (including the score), would you like me to provide the Database Schema for a hierarchical Geography Context that supports 1-to-many relationships between Provinces, Districts, and Wards?**
