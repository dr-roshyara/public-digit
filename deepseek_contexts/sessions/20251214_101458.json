Spatie Multitenancy. Laravel Sanctum. Current known issues: tenant provisioning failures, admin user creation problems, password column mismatches.\n\nCRITICAL CLAUDE.md RULES:\n- **MUST NOT** make changes without explicit user approval\n- Use MUST/MUST NOT/SHOULD directive patterns\n- **MUST NOT** move or refactor `packages/laravel-backend/` structure\n- **MUST NOT** modify existing route files without user confirmation\n- **MUST** treat mobile app as ADDITIVE client, not replacement\n- **MUST** verify route is not already defined before adding\n**1. config/reserved-slugs.php** - Slugs that CANNOT be used as tenant identifiers\n- Unknown slugs in `/{tenant}/*` routes should NOT be used as tenant context\n- [ ] Reserved slugs ('api', 'mapi', 'admin', etc.) not used as tenant slugs\n- [ ] Route not already defined in another file\n- Mobile API routes return JSON (not HTML)\n2. **Reserved Slugs**: 'api' and other platform routes cannot be used as tenant slugs\n**CRITICAL: Angular MUST use `/mapi/*` routes (NOT `/api/*`)**\n- NO - Do NOT create this dangerous raw SQL migration.\n1. **Database Agnosticism**: Using `IF NOT EXISTS` is MySQL-specific. Laravel migrations should work on PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.\n\n\nRECENT ACTIVITY:\n"
